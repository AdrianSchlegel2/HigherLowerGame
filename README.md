# HigherLowerGame
 A game where you have to enter a number *(between 0 and 9)*, and the program tells you if the number it is thinking of is higher or lower of your guess. This program is the first time I actually tried some backend development, by using the **flask library** and **python**. 
 *To play the game, you first of all have to start the program, which hosts the server over your computer. Then you enter the link which was presented through your console into your browser (i used google chrome). To actually play the you have to enter your guess into the search bar after the home route with a /.
 Example: http://131.6.6.3:1367/3 (your guess)*
 **This Link does not actually work. You have to host your own server for this to work**
